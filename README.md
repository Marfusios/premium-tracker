## ‚ú® Overview

The **IBKR Portfolio Analyzer** is a sophisticated, privacy-focused web application designed for traders who want to gain deeper insights from their Interactive Brokers activity statements. While beneficial for all investors, it has a special focus on visualizing and calculating key performance and risk metrics for short option strategies, particularly **The Wheel**.

This tool processes your entire activity statement CSV file directly in your browser, ensuring your financial data remains completely private and never leaves your computer.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Privacy First**: All data processing is done client-side. Your statement is **never** uploaded to any server.

-   **Advanced Options Analysis**:
    -   **Wheel Strategy Tracking**: Automatically identifies and analyzes completed and pending Wheel cycles, calculating total P/L, premiums, duration, and annualized returns.
    -   **Short Put Risk Management**: Visualizes your potential collateral requirements for short puts, separating them by risk (In-the-Money vs. Out-of-the-Money) and calculating potential cash shortfalls.
    -   **Performance Metrics**: Track your options win rate, assignment rate, premium capture, and Annualized Return on Capital (AROC).
-   **Stunning Visualizations**:
    -   **NAV Flow Sankey Chart**: Understand exactly what contributed to the change in your portfolio's value over the period.
    -   **Interactive Charts**: Analyze monthly income/P&L, cost breakdowns, and P&L contribution by ticker with beautiful bar and pie charts.
-   **Multi-Language & Multi-Currency**: View your dashboard in multiple languages and convert all financial data to your preferred currency with a single click.
-   **Public Shareable View**: Generate a clean, anonymized, and shareable snapshot of your portfolio's key metrics to share your performance with others.
